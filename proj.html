                                This past summer, I had the opportunity to work as an intern for NASA JPL's Group 389G, the <a href=https://microdevices.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news-infrared-detector.php>Infrared Photonics Group</a>. 
                                Their task for me was to create a script to handle data processing of current-voltage curves, information that would be used to quanitfy the quality of their proprietary infrared photodetectors. 
                                I instead opted to make IRIS (Infrared Informatics Software), a full-scale desktop application designed to create maximum abstraction between the code and the researcher.<br>
                                
                                <h2>Description</h2>
                                IRIS is first and foremost a data analytics application. 
                                Two-thirds of the UI is a graphing widget that is designed to depict the processed data elegantly and clearly. 
                                The graphing widget also allows precise zoomin and traversal. 
                                IRIS takes in selected raw data files that depict the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_current_(physics)>dark current</a> response oftested photodetectors at near absolute zero temperatures and between operating voltages of -1.5 and +1.5 Volts.
                                The user then has the option to filter the data according to user-defined values. 
                                Once the "Generate Analysis" button is clicked, the data will be processed within one to two seconds and plotted to the graphing widget. 
                                There are 3 buttons and a photodetector selection list to allow the user to select what plot type, temperature, and voltage to view the processed IV data of the selected devices. 
                                There are 10 plot types that each uniquely process the raw data. 
                                The user can quickly traverse plot types at the click of a button. 
                                All of the plots can be downloaded as formatted CSV files.<br>

                                <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                                Prior to my arrival, 389G faced the dilemma of having to spend laborous time curating and processing data files
                                with a closed-source data analytics platform. The group was only allowed one license to this application, so curating
                                was primarily my mentor's job. 
                                Thus, IRIS was designed to allow group-wide access to the processed data and automation of data processing. The original
                                specifications for my task was just to create the processing automation script. I chose to create a full-scale
                                application that made the processed data accessible to the whole group (and anyone else who uses the application).<br><br>

                                I also ensured that the code remained heavily documented and easily scalable such that IRIS can provide more views
                                for the data that Group 389G researches. You can read the usage and development guide I created for IRIS <a href=files/IRISManual.pdf>here</a>.

                                LyReq is a lyrical analysis program I made to fetch a specific song's lyrics from <a href=https://genius.com/>Genius.com</a>
                                and depict the song's lyrical repetetiveness, which was inspired by an algorithm called <a href=https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1777-songsim>SongSim</a>.

                                Written in Python, the program operates on a command line prompt, requesting an artist name and song from the user.
                                If the artist and accompanying song exist in the Genius database, the script will scrape the HTML on the appropriate Genius webpage, returning a
                                list of words under the "lyrics" class in the markup. This list will be further parsed to find which words are repeated in the song. This will be 
                                represented by a square matrix where the x and y axis list the lyrics by word. An entry will contain a "True" value if its x and y indices contain
                                the same word. LyReq will create a .png file depicting the repetition pattern, where a red pixel denotes a "True" value.

                                I took my Intro to Computer Architecture course in Spring 2018. The main design assignment was to design a single-core, 5-stage pipelined CPU that runs
                                <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V>RISC-V</a> 32-bit architecture on Logisim, an app for circuit design. The 
                                skeleton code only came with a harness to test the CPU, so the final design of the device was completely up to each student's discretion. Project success 
                                was determined by how may unqiue instructions the CPU correctly processed and executed.

                                For the final design project for my Data Structures class (taken in Fall 2017), I created Gitlet, a version control system that contains a subset of 
                                Git's commands and functionality. The entire project was developed in Java from scratch.

                                During the summer of 2017, I was accepted into a research internship program in the <a href=https://www.comnets.uni-bremen.de/start/>ComNets</a> group at the University of Bremen in Germany.
                                Here, I had the task of creating a device that could monitor the number of people in a room and report this data to a server where the information
                                could be accessed remotely and by any individuals on the same network. Using an Arduino Nano with an ESP266 WiFi module, some infrared sensors, and bit of Python
                                networking, I created the Room Occupancy Monitor (ROM for short).

                                <h2>Description</h2>
                                ROM is physcially constructed with a Pretzel Board, a device that combines Arduino Nano hardware with the ESP266 WiFi attachment. It is about 4 inches
                                in length. Attached to the board are two line-of-sight infrared signal transmitter/receivers that outputs a signal based on the intensity of the infrared
                                reflected back to the device. The programming of the device was completed in the Arduino IDE. The general logic is as follows:<br><br>
                                <b>Setup:</b><br> <li>Calibrate the intensity of the reflected signal for the two infrared sensors. This will be the baseline signal. Any spike in value denotes that a
                                person has passed line-of-sight, triggering an increase in reflection. The spike must be significant to register an "entry" or "exit".</li>
                                <li> Establish the connection to the LAN in order to communicate with the host server that contains the Python socket script.</li><br>
                                <b>Mainloop:</b><br>
                                <li>Both sensors are attached to the doorway, one inside the room and one outside. Depending on which sensor is tripped first, the device will
                                    log an "entry" or "exit".</li>
                                <li>Every five seconds, report the current occupancy of the room to the Python socket over UDP connection.</li><br>

                                <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                                Most occupancy monitors on the commerical market are priced well over $150. ROM costs just $30 in total hardware cost.
                                I built ROM with the intention to minimize cost and complexity. In fact, the hardware for the device is composed of the Pretzel Board, two infrared sensors,
                                and two resistors for the sensors. Despite this, the device works up to specifications, accurately reporting occupancy of the room it is placed in.
