              This past summer, I had the opportunity to work as an intern for NASA's Group 389G, 
              the Infrared Photonics Group. Their task for me was to create a simple script to handle data 
              processing of current-voltage curves, information that would be used to quanitfy the quality 
              of their proprietary infrared photodetectors. I instead opted to make IRIS (Infrared Informatics 
              Software), a full-scale desktop application designed to create maximum abstraction between the 
              code and the researcher.
